1. **Go to your GitHub repository**:
   https://github.com/barcarolol-bit/verbalized

2. **Click the "Deploy with Vercel" button** in the README

3. **Sign in with GitHub** (if not already signed in)

4. **Add your API keys** when prompted:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
   OLLAMA_API_KEY=your-key-here
   OLLAMA_BASE_URL=https://ollama.com/api
   OLLAMA_MODEL=gpt-oss:120b-cloud
   ```

5. **Click "Deploy"** and wait ~2 minutes

6. **Get your live URL!** (e.g., `verbalized.vercel.app`)

### Option 2: Manual Vercel Setup

1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "Add New..." → "Project"
4. Import `barcarolol-bit/verbalized`

## ⚠️ Why Not GitHub Pages?

**GitHub Pages only supports static HTML/CSS/JS files.**

Your Verbalized app needs:
- ✅ Node.js server (for API routes)
- ✅ Server-side processing (transcription & composition)
- ✅ Environment variables (API keys)

**Solution**: Use Vercel, Netlify, Railway, or Render instead!

All of these platforms:
- ✅ Have free tiers
- ✅ Support Next.js apps
- ✅ Auto-deploy from GitHub
- ✅ Provide HTTPS
- ✅ Offer global CDN
